## What leverage should beginners use on derivatives platforms?

Start with 3x to 5x leverage to reduce liquidation risk while learning how margin trading works. Lower leverage gives you more breathing room when markets move against your position, letting you understand funding rates, maintenance margins, and position sizing without immediately facing forced closures. Once you're comfortable reading market conditions and managing risk, you can gradually increase leverage based on your strategy and risk tolerance.

## How do perpetual contracts differ from traditional futures?

Perpetual contracts never expire—you can hold positions indefinitely as long as you maintain sufficient margin. Traditional futures have fixed settlement dates (weekly, monthly, or quarterly) when contracts automatically close. Perpetuals use funding rate mechanisms every 8 hours where longs pay shorts or vice versa, keeping contract prices anchored to spot markets. This makes perpetuals feel more like leveraged spot trading, while traditional futures require rolling positions forward if you want continued exposure.

## What's the difference between USDT-margined and coin-margined contracts?

USDT-margined contracts settle in stablecoins, making profit and loss calculations straightforward in dollar terms. Coin-margined (inverse) contracts settle in the underlying cryptocurrency, creating nonlinear P&L curves since both your position and collateral fluctuate with the asset's price. Traders preferring stable value accounting choose USDT-margined, while those wanting to accumulate more Bitcoin or Ethereum often select coin-margined products.
